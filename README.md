# Maternal Health Data Analysis

This repository contains a machine learning analysis project focused on maternal health, aiming to improve health outcomes through evidence-based actions. The project utilizes statistical modeling, principal component analysis (PCA), and data visualization techniques to gain insights into maternal health data.

## Context
Maternal health refers to the well-being of women during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. Despite significant advancements in recent years, the number of maternal deaths remains unacceptably high, with 295,000 women dying during or after pregnancy and childbirth in 2017. The most common direct causes of maternal injury and death include excessive blood loss, infection, and high blood pressure. Timely management by skilled professionals working across disciplines can significantly reduce maternal mortality rates.

## Task
As a data scientist collaborating with clinicians, the objective is to analyze maternal health data and identify evidence-based actions to improve health outcomes. The following questions will be addressed in the project:

1. Build and fit a linear model using the systolic blood pressure (BP) as the response variable and select exploratory variables of choice.
2. Apply principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables.
3. Investigate the relationship between age and heart rate by grouping age intervals and provide graphical representations.
4. Investigate associations between pairs of high/high, normal/normal, and low/low diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Calculate and interpret support, confidence, conviction, and lift.
5. Find clusters of patients with similar systolic blood pressure.
6. Calculate the correlation between age and systolic blood pressure and interpret the result.
